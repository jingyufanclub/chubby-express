Chubby is a great way to pass the time. There are no winners and no losers.

To play:

Simply click on "Start" and food (smiling hearts) will begin to fall from the sky. Use the down, up, right and left keys to move Chubby around the window and eat up the falling food.

The more she eats, the bigger she gets, until she simply cannot grow anymore.

Watch what happens!

Chubby now runs on Koa server.
Execute ```npm start``` or ```npm run docker```.
